# Basic Quest System

Basic quest system where 1 node = 1 quest

Only "bring me x things" type of quests are available.
Minimal inventory implementation for these quests and "gold coins" as quest items

### TODO
- [ ] GUI (for inventory and quests)
- [x] Fix the bug where a quest is automatically completed when the player has the required amount of items to complete the quest before starting the quest
- [ ] Other type of quest (Move/deliver something, kill x thing, talk/escort someone etc.)
